 <h3 id="headline">Here is a brief time line of Dr. Earle's life:</h3>
   
   <ul>
      <li><strong>1935</strong> - Born in Gibbstown, New Jersey
     </li>
      
     <li><strong>1948</strong> - SylviaÂ´s family moved to Clearwater, Florida, on the Gulf of Mexico and she started learning about the wildlife of the Gulf.
     </li>
        
   <li><strong>1950s</strong> - Throughout her school years, she supported herself by working in college laboratories and won scholarships to the Florida State. After earning her Master's at Duke University, she took time off to start a family.
          </li>
  
  <li><strong>1964</strong> - She joins a six weeks National Science Foundation expedition in the Indian Ocean, trying to balance her family with scientific expeditions.
     </li>
          
    <li><strong>1966</strong> - Received her Ph.D. from Duke after a long and detailed first-hand study of aquatic plant life.
     </li>
     
    <li><strong>1968</strong> - Dr. Earle traveled to a hundred feet below the waters of the Bahamas in the submersible Deep Diver
     </li>
     
     <li><strong>1969</strong> - She applied to participate in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektite_habitat"> Tektite Project</a>; sponsored jointly by the U.S. Navy, the Department of the Interior and NASA, allowed scientist to live for weeks in an enclosed habitat on the ocean floor fifty feet below the surface, off the Virgin Islands
     </li>
     
      <li><strong>1970s</strong> - Scientific missions took Sylvia Earle to the Galapagos, to the water off Panama, to China and the Bahamas and, again, to the Indian Ocean. 
        </li>
    
     <li><strong>1977</strong> - Together with undersea photographer Al Giddings, made their first voyage following the great sperm whales. In a series of expeditions they followed the whales from Hawaii to New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Bermuda and Alaska. Their journeys were recorded in the documentary film Gentle Giants of the Pacific (1980)
        </li>
     
      <li><strong>1979</strong> - Sylvia Earle walked on the sea floor at a lower depth than any living human being before or since. In the so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIM_suit"> Jim suit</a>, a pressurized one-atmosphere garment, she was carried by a submersible down to the depth of 1,250 feet below the ocean's surface off of the island of Oahu. At the bottom, she detached from the vessel and explored the depths for two and a half hours with only a communication line connecting her to the submersible, and nothing at all connecting her to the world above. She described this adventure in her book 'Exploring the Deep Frontier'
        </li>
     
     <li><strong>1980s</strong> - Along with engineer Graham Hawkes, she started the companies Deep Ocean Engineering and Deep Ocean Technologies
     </li>

     <li><strong>1990s</strong> - Dr. Earle took time off from her companies to serve as Chief Scientist of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
      </li>
        
     <li><strong>2000s</strong> - She is explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society and keeps diving and researching our oceans.</li>
